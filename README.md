## 💡 Inspiration
- Mines are some of the most attractive weapons available to any determined adversary and represent one of the most vexing military challenges.
- Sea mines are perhaps the most lethal form of these weapons, as they are hard to find, difficult to neutralize, and can present a deadly hazard to any vessel.
- So here we come in with DodgeMine to predict the best possible route while travelling in a marine vehicle.

## 💻 What it does
- The machine learning system, which is based on the neural network, needs a training data set that consists of samples of rocks and mines. 
- The training set, which has a distance between the samples, is given to the system, which results in a classification system where each sample has a score that shows its closeness to the other samples.
- Based on this closeness, the system predicts a safe pathway between the two samples. The system, based on the machine learning model, consists of two parts: one for analysing the sonar radiation and the other for classifying the samples.
- This system can be easily applied to a variety of applications that require intelligent classification.

## ⚙️ How we built it
- The Client end of our website was built by using HTML,CSS and JS.
- We used Logistic Regression for training the model.
- We used Flask for our server to integrate an ML model with our website.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into
- Getting datasets for detecting mines or rocks was a bit difficult.
- Selecting a perfect machine learning algorithm was a hard task.
- As we are new to flask, We spend more time in integrating our model with our front end.

## 📖 What we learned
- We learned to train a model within a short span of time.
- We learned flask how to integrate a ML model with the client end.
- We learned about the pickle package in Python, which is used for prediction.

## 📧 Use of Twilio
- We used Twilio to send mine vs rock report to our users. 
- Twilio is safe and secure API for sending text messages.

## ☁️ Use of Google Cloud
- Google Cloud offers Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
- We used google cloud logistic regression machine learning model to train our model.

## 📖 Use of deso
- Deso is a decentralized social application and it is open source & on chain open data
- We used deso for login, logout purpose and also for transactions occurs in our website.

## 🚀 What's next for Dodge Mine
- To upload input data as a file format.
- To feed the model with more datasets and to increase its accuracy.
- To test the dataset with different algorithms and to find the optimal algorithm.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We're glad to sucessfully complete this project!
- The end goal was met to a satisfactory level, and the outcome would allow help seaman to detect mine accurately and
make them to have a safe jorney.
